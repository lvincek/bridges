<h2>The Mission</h2>


<p>Bridges to Manila is a non-profit organization that provides financial assistance to students and schools in need in the Philippines.  With headquarters in Walnut Creek, CA, it has global support with participation throughout the United States, the Philippines and Europe.
</p>
 
<p>With the mission of helping to educate and provide opportunities for youth in the Philippines, Bridges to Manila has primarily focused their financial efforts at Western Visayas State University (WVSU).  Initially, we provided scholarships but it was also very clear that there was a greater need to help improve the infrastructure as the campus buildings were outdated and more improvements were needed.</p>

<p>100% of all funds go directly to providing education and to infrastructure projects at WVSU.  The team at Bridges to Manila works directly with the administration with budgets reviewed annually.</p>

<h2>Our History</h2>

<p>Bridges to Manila was founded in 2008 as the continued work of Dr. Ramon Castro, who was born in Calinog, Iloilo, Philippines.  His son, Rick, had started the organization by first providing funds and scholarships for students in need and soon realized that there is a greater need for more support.  He expanded Bridges to Manila to include his brothers and other supporters.</p>
 
<p>Bridges to Manila has benefited by financial support through many donors and fundraisers throughout the years.  Fundraising events have been held in San Francisco, Chicago, Denver and Ohio.</p>
