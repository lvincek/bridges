<p>The Philippines, with more than 7000 islands and 100 million citizens, faces numerous problems today that put a strain on its educational system.&#160 These issues include poor central government funding, poverty throughout the country, varying rural standards of education and a severe climate, punctuated with typhoons and earthquakes.<p>
 
<p>In the rural Philippines, in places like Calinog, where Western Visayas State University is located, there are additional problems.&#160 These areas lag even further in government funding, the students often live far from their village and canâ€™t afford tuition or housing and subsistence.&#160 Farming in communities mean students at a young age are often encouraged to work in the fields instead of going to school.&#160 With little electricity or running water, and malnutrition to compound these problems, education lags in priorities.</p>
