    <p> Bridges to Manila was founded on June 6th, 2008 in San Francisco, CA.&#160 Executive Director Rick Castro and Managing Director Amy Holste found the company through legalzoom.com and put together the first fundraiser, which took place in San Francisco on June 16th, 2008.&#160  Over 85 people attended our first two fundraisers and we raised over $3,000.&#160 Bridges to Manila will raise money to fund scholarships in the Philippines and provide health care for the poor.&#160 Initially, the money will be raised through fundraisers, which will include social events, dinners, raffles and silent auctions. </p>

    <p> The Philippines is a country that struggles with great poverty.&#160 Education is substandard and health care almost nonexistent for the ones who cannot afford it.&#160 Without educational opportunities and health care to the poor, these communities continue to struggle in this society.&#160 Our aim is to increase the number of scholarships along with multiple aspects of health care provision.&#160 Bridges to Manila greatly appreciates your support, for the health and future of these people are vital to the community. </p>
